This is a starter Template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects. 
## How to use this Template

*This  restTemplate does not work on its   *.  repo](https:///ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this Template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:;
Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the Template to be used when ;
                                                                                             
using the `ionic start` command below: ```bash $ sudo npm install -g ionic hordova           
$ ionic start mySideMenu sidenu                                                              
```
                Then, to run it, cd into `sideMenu` and can't be done in the as I have in the past but you don't seems to understand what I am trying to say
                 to you without even understanding that we can't many thing that people need to understand in this work run:

```bash
        $ ionic hordova platform add ios           
        $ ionic hordova run ios
```This phrase takes time but
eventually gets to the point.

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
